Run the following commands to install them: ``` npm install install ``` Make sure Electron says `^9.4.4` in the __package.json__, everything else can be updated to it's latest version. The reason why we use Electron 9.4.4 is because the new terminal built-in won't work properly on later versions of Elecron. Make sure Electron Builder are under `devDependencies` in the __package.json__ file or it will refuse to build. ## Running After all required dependencies are installed, you should be able to run the software with the start command provided in __package.json__. To run the start command, simply run the following command: ``` npm start ``` ## Create a Package Wanna create an installer? You can do this with Electron Builder, there is already a build command ready which is provided in __package.json__. To start building the installer, run the following command: ``` npm run build ``` NOTE: If you're using versions of Windows older than Windows 10, please change `appx` to `exe` in the build configuration found in __package.json__, `appx` files are for Windows 10 only. If you're using Windows 10, Electron may have some issues building the APPX file, as we don't use Electron Builder for Window 10. ",

    "content": "In Progress {: .label .label-yellow } # Registering a Domain Why a domain? A custom IP address like __hypixel.net__ is a domain and you need one to create a custom IP address for your Minecraft server. ## Choosing a Domain Provider There are a lot of places where you can register a domain. Here's a list of where you can register a paid domain: * [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) * [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) * [bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) * [Google](https://domains.google/) * [Hover](https://www.hover.com/) If you're wanting to register a free domain, please use [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com/). ### Quick FAQ for Domains **Do I own the domain permanently?** No, you have to renew the domain yearly. However, you can pay up to more than one year. As an example, you can pay a domain up to 10 years or less if would like to. **How do I keep my domain safe?** If you continue reading down below, we'll explain how to add your domain to Cloudflare. Cloudflare offers free SSL and DDOS protection. If you're not interested in using Cloudflare, you'll need to pay extra money to your domain provider for SSL and DDOS protection. **What if I don't renew it?** Once the domain has expired, it will be available again for purchase to the public. ## Adding to Cloudflare Why Cloudflare? You're required to use an SRV Record which some domain providers like Freenom don't offer in their DNS settings. What is DNS? Learn about that [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/). Create a Cloudflare account, afterwards, click Add Site. Add your domain like __example.com__, do not add *http://*. Select the free plan option, click next. When reviewing your DNS, just click continue, we will set this up later. Cloudflare will then display the two nameservers, which you will need to add to your domain on your domain provider. If you're unsure how to change your nameservers, select the help article for this, for your domain provider: * [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/767/10/how-to-change-dns-for-a-domain/) * [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/change-nameservers-for-my-domains-664) * [bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/help/article/custom-nameservers) * [Google](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3290309?hl=en) * [Hover](https://help.hover.com/hc/en-us/articles/217282477--Changing-your-domain-nameservers) * [Freenom](https://my.freenom.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&id=3) Once done, wait around 20 - 45 minutes for Cloudflare to confirm your site has been added. # Manage Domain ## Creating an A Record In the DNS settings, of your domain, add a new A Record. For the name, use `@`. Then use the numberic IP address for the IPv4 Address, do not include the port number. It should look like this: | Record Type | Name | IPv4 Address | ----------- | --------- | ------------ | A | @ | 00.000.00.00 | ## Creating a SRV Record In the DNS settings, of your domain, add a new A Record. For the name use `@`. For Service, use `_minecraft`. For Prority, use `0` and for Weight use `5`. Then, use your server's port number for Port. Lastly, set your Target as `@`. It should look like this: | Record Type | Name | Service | Priority | Weight | Port | Target | ----------- | --------- | ------------ | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | SRV | @ | _minecraft | 0 | 5 | 000000 | @ | ",

After that, click on bot on the side menu, press add bot and confirm it. You've sucessfully created the bot account! ## Coding a Bot To code your bot and to do the following steps you must have basic knowledge of NodeJS and a code editor installed on your PC such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/), but you can use one of your liking. ### Prepare Everything * Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest version) on your local machine; * Create a folder for your bot and open the terminal in there; * Create a new file called index.js in the folder. This will be the main bot file; * Create a `package.json` file by typing `npm init -y` in the terminal, in that folder; * Type `npm install discord.js`in the terminal, in the same folder, and wait for it to install; ### Essential Coding Once discord.js is fully installed, open the index.js file and type the following: ``` const Discord = require('discord.js') const client = new Discord.Client() ``` We have defined the client. Now we will make an event for when the bot is ready. This will print a message in the console when the bot is ready to be used: ``` client.once('ready', () =>{ console.log ('Bot Is Online'); }); ``` Now, we will make a simple command ``` client.on(\"message\", async message => { if (message.content === '!ping') { message.channel.send('Pong!') } }); ``` We have made a command. Now let's specify to the script our bot TOKEN. This will tell it what account to use. To get the TOKEN, go to [discord developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and in your application, click on Bot, and copy the token The Token is like a password, so don't share it with anyone! `client.run('Your Super Secret Token')` ## Hosting The Bot To host your bot in our service, you need a server.

    "title": "DiscordSRV",
    "content": "DiscordSRV . Download this Plugin # What is DiscordSRV Using this plugin, you are able to give players the ability to chat in-game to chat with players on your Discord server as well as having people on the Discord server be able to chat with people on the server- this is useful for the situation of someone not being at their computer and being able to talk in-game. As well as that, this plugin also has a remote console feature. You can designate a text channel for the plugin to listen on where messages sent to that channel are run as commands by the server console. You should restrict sending this channel to a developer or high ranking role only. Due to how Discord's permissions work, though, you can have some server roles being able to see the console, yet not being able to send messages in that channel, thus creating a read-only console for trusted staff members. Both the chat and console link are toggleable through the configuration file. Some, but not all, options can be refreshed with /discord reload, by an op. VanishNoPacket permissions like silent join/quit, fake join/quit and join without announcing are checked when sending player join messages in the chat channel. # Installation Process Like any other plugin, you'll need to download the __.jar__ file of DiscordSRV, then add it to your plugins folder. Once you've added DiscordSRV to your plugins folder, fully restart the server, and all configuration files will be generated for DiscordSRV. You can download DiscordSRV by clicking \"Dowload this Plugin\" above. # Creating your Discord Bot Before continuing, creating a bot on Discord is needed in order to proceed to the next step. ## Creating In the Discord Developer dashboard, create a new application. Then, on the application's page, go to the Bot tab, click Add Bot, and confirm. Enable the **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** option under \"Privileged Gateway Intents\" on the bot tab as well. ## Inviting Inviting your bot is easy, in the bot's General Information tab, copy the applications' ID. Go [here](https://scarsz.me/authorize), then press Ctrl V to paste the ID. This will redirect you to the bot's invite link. Invite the bot to the server you want it in. # Configuration ## Sync Plugin with Discord Bot In order for your Minecraft server's chat to send to your Discord server, you'll need to add your bot's token to the plugin's configuration. To find your bot's token, head back to your Discord Developer dasboard, click on your applications, go to the Bot tab. Click the Copy button under token. In the __config.yml__ file of DiscordSRV, paste the token where it says BotToken, usually on line 5. ## Setting Channel on your Discord Server We need to tell DiscordSRV which channel on your Discord server it should send the chat to. In the __config.yml__ file of DiscordSRV, there is a place to add your channel ID, usually on line 11. Replace \"0000000000\" with your channel ID. To get your channel ID, right click on the channel you want to set for the Minecraft chat, then click on Copy ID. If Copy ID option is not showing, please enable Developer Mode in your Discord's Advanced settings. Optionally, you can set a console channel in your Discord server too. This can be used to send commands to your server from Discord, please keep this channel hidden from other members and only visible to admins. ",

Due to its ability to affect all aspects of the game, command blocks are not accessible in survival mode. ## Different Types **Impulse**: Runs commands with a redstone signal. That means once powered they will run the command once and then stop. **Repeat**: Runs the commands every game tick they are powered by default. Multiple commands can be run in a single tick. You can also set the delay between each tick or list of commands being executed. **Chain**: Can only be executed once the previous blocks have gone through their set of commands.

Once done, click the Create button and wait at least a minute in the Client Panel for the new server to be created for your account. Now, in the [Game Panel](https://panel.falix.gg/) you should see the new server on your server list. If the server list indicates that it is still installing, wait at least 2 to 5 minutes for the installation to be complete. If the installation is taking longer than usual (over 5 to 10 minutes or more), head back to your [Client Panel](https://client.falix.gg/) and delete, then re-create the server. Select your new server and go to the Console tab, usually already selected by default. Click the Start button, located in the upper left corner of the Console tab. You're going to be selecting which type of server you want during the first startup of your new server. In this case, we're creating a Minecraft Java server, to select Minecraft Java, then the type of Minecraft Java server that you want like Vanilla or PaperMC, and select the version of Minecraft Java you want to play on. Your server should've crashed with the exit code \"0\" and with an error message that says \"`You need to agree to the EULA in order to run the server. Go to eula.txt for more info.`\". You will have to accept to [Mojang's EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula) in order to start your server. # Choosing Your Server Java Version ## Minecraft Versions Use **Java 8** for Minecraft 1.12.2 or older Use **Java 11** for Minecraft 1.13 or newer ## Set a Default Version > Make sure your server is turned off before doing the next steps. To make a Java version the default one, so that you don't need to select it every time you start your server, visit the [game panel](https://panel.falixnodes.net/), find and click on your server, find the \"Startup\" page on the top bar, scroll down to \"Variables\", then find \"JAVA VERSION\" and type the following for: ## Java8 `adopt@1.8.0-275` ## Java11 `adopt@1.11.0-9` Now, go back to your console, start your server and you'll see it using the Java version you set. > If the above does not work, manually delete the `.jabba` folder and restart your server. # Accepting Mojang's EULA In order to start your server, you must accept [Mojang's EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula). If you agree to it, go to your server's file manager, find and open the file \"`eula.txt`\", find the \"`eula`\" string and set it to `true`. # Configuring ## Message of the Day Also known as MOTD, is the message that shows up below the server name on a multiplayer server list. Usually used to say what's new about the server and/or also displaying what version it supports. Sometimes also used to indicate what games it has to offer or just a short description of the server. To configure MOTD(Message of the Day), the setting for this is usually found in the server.properties file. Simply just change it to what you want for your Minecraft Java Server. If you're interested in changing text colors, use these color codes: View Colors Colors | COLOR_BLOCK | Black | \\u00A70 | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Dark Blue | \\u00A71 | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Blue | \\u00A79 | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Dark Green | \\u00A72 | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Green | \\u00A7a | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Dark Aqua | \\u00A73 | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Aqua | \\u00A7b | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Dark Red | \\u00A70 | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Red | \\u00A7c | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Dark Purple | \\u00A75 | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Gold | \\u00A76 | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Yellow | \\u00A7e | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Light Purple | \\u00A7d | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Gray | \\u00A77 | . | COLOR_BLOCK | Dark Gray | \\u00A78 | . | COLOR_BLOCK | White | \\u00A7f | . ## Server Icon The server icon helps indicate the branding of your Minecraft Java server, it's easy to set one. Simply create an icon that is 64x64 in resolution. Name the server icon as server-icon.png and add it to the root of your Minecraft Java server files. ## Player Limit By default, Minecraft sets 20 as the max player limit for Minecraft Java servers. You can increase this, or decrease, to any number you want. To configure the player limit, the setting for this is usually found in the server.properties file. Simply, just change the number 20 to something else, you could also set -1 for unlimited. # Setting Operators An operator is a player with administrative access to your server, giving them full access to all commands. Even commands like /stop or /restart. To set an operator, use: ``` /op Username ``` As an example, if you wanted to op Notch, you would use: ``` /op Notch ``` Please don't use `/` in the Console tab. If you want to give some players access to specific admin commands, but not everything, you can use [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) for this, which we recommend. # Connecting ## Find your Server IP Address In your [Game Panel](https://panel.falix.gg/) the IP is shown in the upper left on the Console tab. Use this to connect to your server.

To gain access to features like console, file manager, databases, and more you need to head over to our Game Panel. # Getting to Know the Username Interface The client panel where you will manage your server's resources, controlling the number of resources like CPU, memory, databases, ports, and more. Here in the Client Panel, you can also create servers and obtain your panel login information. ",

    "content": "# Explanation ## What are They? Plugins are similar to browser extensions in Minecraft. These are used by third-party developers to write additional code and plug it into the server. Since they do not change the game itself, as mods do, they are more constrained in what they can do. This, however, implies that they only need to be installed on the server's side. There are no changes required in your own game files to achieve this result. Plugins perform a number of functions and do not have a particular purpose. They can add a wide assortment of extra commands to help control the server and add in fun and useful mechanics, such as the ability to set who can access and construct in specific areas, add prefixes and suffixes to names, create different ranks with access to different commands, add RPG elements, add virtual economies, and much more. To spice up your server, there are thousands of plugins available in the Bukkit and Spigot repositories. However, since most of these plugins are created by different developers, incompatibility issues and bugs can spring up whenever a large number of plugins are installed. Sticking to the most widely known plugins is the right alternative since they've been in development for years, are far more mature, and have no compatibility problems with other plugins. ## Difference Between Plugins and Mods Plugins are used to modify and/or improve existing Minecraft server content and can be run using CraftBukkit/Spigot/Paper. They are only used on the server, so players will not have to take any extra steps to connect to a server that's already running plugins. Mods, which are usually run from Forge, are used to add new items/features to Minecraft and/or improve the existing gameplay. Mods are often required from both the client and server sides (for example, \"Biomes O' Plenty\"), but some mods are only designed for the client (such as \"Optifine\" or \"Damage Indicators\"). Mods can also be put together to form what is known as a modpack (such as \"All The Mods 3\" or \"Sky Factory\"). Overall, mods and plugins often don't get along, so it's unlikely that you'll be able to successfully start operating a server for both. However, it is possible, notably if you are willing to run an older version of Minecraft (the most popular for plugin/mod compatibility are 1.7.10 or 1.6.4). # Installation ## Where to Download? There are a lot of websites that provide plugins for server administrators. Here's a list of common websites to choose from: - [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) - [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/) Some plugins may have their own website. ## Installation to Server After downloading a plugin, you should have a __.jar__ file to upload to your server, or they can come in a ZIP as a plugin is divided up into multiple __.jar__ files. These __.jar__ files will be assigned to a specific folder on your Minecraft server, which itself is typically called \"plugins.\" Once added, restart your server; a new folder in the plugins folder should appear, usually contains the plugin's configuration. # Configuration ## What is Plugin Configuration? In order for server administrators to be able to change the settings of a plugin, a configuration file can be used, as previously stated: \"a new folder in the plugins folder should appear, usually contains the plugin's configuration.\" ## Configuring In the plugins folder, there will be a folder with the plugin's name. You can edit the config file, usually marked as __.yml__ file to change the settigs to the plugin. Some plugins, like LuckPerms, may have a GUI you can use in browser to do configuration and more. ",

You can only mine either with the CPU or the GPU at the same time. Mining can only be performed on one device at a time. ## Windows Download the miner from [here](https://github.com/FalixInc/FalixCoins-Miner/releases/) and save it to your desktop or perhaps another place into a folder. Open the command prompt, Powershell, or Windows Terminal as administrator. Change directory to the folder that you downloaded the miner; if you saved the miner to a new folder on your desktop, the command would look something like this: ``` cd C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop\\Folder-Name\\ ``` > Replace `Username` with your username and `Folder-Name` with the name you set ### For CPU Mining Only: Now type the following command: ``` falixnodes_miner-win.exe YourDiscordIDHere Threads ``` > Replace `YourDiscordIDHere` with your [Discord ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498) and replace `Threads` with the numbers of threads you want to allocate for mining. ### For GPU Mining Only: Now type the following command: ``` falixnodes_gpu_miner-win.exe YourDiscordIDHere MaxGPUUsage ``` > Replace `YourDiscordIDHere` with your [Discord ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498) and replace `MaxGPUUage` with the max percentage of GPU uage you want from 1 to 100. ## Linux Download the miner from [here](https://github.com/FalixInc/FalixCoins-Miner/releases/) and save it to your desktop or perhaps another place into a folder. Open your terminal and change directory to the folder that you downloaded the miner; if you saved the miner to a new folder on your desktop, the command would look something like this: ``` cd ~/Desktop/Folder-Name ``` > Replace `Folder-Name` with the name you set Then run this command: ``` chmod u+x ./falixnodes* ``` ### For CPU Mining Only: Now type the following command: ``` sudo ./falixnodes_miner-linux YourDiscordIDHere Threads ``` > Replace `YourDiscordIDHere` with your [Discord ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498) and replace `Threads` with the numbers of threads you want to allocate for mining. ### For GPU Mining Only: Now type the following command: ``` ./falixnodes_gpu_miner-linux YourDiscordIDHere MaxGPUUsage ``` > Replace `YourDiscordIDHere` with your [Discord ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498) and replace `MaxGPUUage` with the max percentage of GPU uage you want from 1 to 100. ## macOS Download the miner from [here](https://github.com/FalixInc/FalixCoins-Miner/releases/) and save it to your desktop or perhaps another place into a folder. Open your terminal and change directory to the folder that you downloaded the miner; if you saved the miner to a new folder on your desktop, the command would look something like this: ``` cd ~/Desktop/Folder-Name ``` > Replace `Folder-Name` with the name you set Then run this command: ``` chmod u+x ./falixnodes* ``` To run the miner, use: ``` sudo ./falixnodes_miner-macos YourDiscordIDHere Threads ``` > Replace `YourDiscordIDHere` with your [Discord ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498) and replace `Threads` with the numbers of threads you want to allocate for mining.

The installation is easy to follow and you should of the software installed within at least 2 minutes or less(depending on your internet speed). ## Windows 10 You can install the software easily in the Microsoft Store on Windows 10. Just search \"Falix\" and the software should show up. Select it and click install. or you can click here: ## macOS Due to restriction with Apple, the software is not available in the App Store, but we have provided a DMG option instead. If you're using macOS, click the download button on the software website. A DMG file will be provided. Open the DMG file and simply drag the Falix app into the Applications folder. ## Linux On Linux, there are many ways to install software like apt, [deb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)), [rpm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager), [pacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux#Pacman), etc. Simply go to our [software website](https://software.falixnodes.net), click Download, then select your distro. # Updating ## Windows 10 Since Falix Software is available in the Microsoft Store, you can easily manage updates. [Learn how to updates app on Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/get-updates-for-apps-and-games-in-microsoft-store-a1fe19c0-532d-ec47-7035-d1c5a1dd464f) ## macOS Auto updating is still not available for macOS users, you'll need to manually install new updates. When a new update is available, just re-download Falix and install the newer version. Uninstalling is not required, when manually installing new updates, it will overwrite the exiting version. ## Linux Auto updating is no longer available for LInux users, you'll need to manually install new updates. When a new update is available, just re-download Falix and install the newer version. Uninstalling is not required, when manually installing new updates, it will overwrite the exiting version. # Uninstalling Process # Troubleshooting ## Stuck on advertisement in Game Panel or Client Panel If you've misclicked on an advertisement in the Client Panel, there is no way to back out. Controls currently don't work properly in the Client tab, you'll need to reload the software. You can reload the software by pressing Ctrl R or clicking the reload button found at the bottom of the Settings tab. If you've misclicked on an advertisement in the Game Panel, click the back button. If for whatever reason this isn't working, click the kill button(x button) and load the panel again. ## Software is not opening For Linux users, assuming you installed from Snap, Snap apps can take a moment to open as they're being sandboxed. The first boot will take longer. Please read and troubleshoot any errors that show up on in your terminal. For Windows users, please check your task manager and see if Falix Software is running. Since it's built on Electron, you may see a few instances of it running. You can kill the process and try again, if it's not working on the second try, you can try re-installing the software. ## Falix Software caused BSOD on Windows This issue has been reported a few times, but has not ben seen by Korbs(developer). If for whatever reason this does happen, please let us know. ## The sidebar is completely transparent You can adjust the transpancy of the sidebar in your Apperances setting, select at least 60% - 100% for the opacity. If the setting isn't working for whatever reason, please report an issue # Troubleshooting - Building These are issues you may get while building the software from GitHub ## Glasstron not found or not defined Glasstron is widely used in the software, you'll need to make sure you've installed it's dependency. To install Glasstron, use the following command: ``` npm install glasstron ``` ## Electron and/or BrowserView not defined This will occur if you've choosen Electron v10 and up. Please only use Electron v9.0.0 - v9.4.3\\. Run the following commands: ``` npm uninstall electron npm install electron@9.4.3 ``` This issue is the reason why we use Electron v9. ## Electron Builder has errors while installing We're not sure what's causing the issue either, please try installing an older version of Electron Builder instead. In our case, we just use: ``` npm install electron-builder@20.0.0 ``` Electron Builder v20 still has all the features we need to build Falix Software, with no issues. ## Appx file won't open If you've built a APPX file on Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, this file can't be used. APPX file is built for Windows 10 only. [What's an APPX file?](https://help.falix.gg/article/falix/software/faq-for-developers/) ## Appx file won't let me install on Windows 10 We recommend that you actually EXE format instead of APPX. Please change the target under Windows to \"nsis\". NSIS will provide a EXE setup file. If you want to use Appx, keep reading: Assuming you've tried to build a Appx file with Electron Builder, we didn't use this. We use Electron Windows Store dependency instead, we use the following command to build: ``` electron-windows-store --input-directory C:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\\Documents\\Desktop-App\\dist\\win-unpacked --output-directory C:\\Falix-Software\\ --package-version 2.3.31.1 --package-name Falix --publisher-display-name \"Korbs Studio\" --identity-name \"32203KorbsStudio.FalixSoftware\" --package-display-name \"Falix Software\" --assets C:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\\Documents\\assets ``` You'll need to setup and change some of these paths and download assets for the Windows 10 version. Also, please do use Electron Builder to unpack the app(usually creates a win-unpacked folder) ",
